# Problem Statement
## Our Problem statement is to build a pixel-perfect Acko website clone. 

#Idea
Since I'm pursuing a Full Stack Web Development course at Masai School I was given a project to clone an Acko-Insurance website, Acko. 
I was given a team of five members including me and the task was to clone the pixel-perfect clone of the website. Let's look at how we designed it ðŸ‘‡
